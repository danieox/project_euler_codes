# Project Euler Solutions
Welcome to my repository of solutions to [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/archives) problems.

As a novice programmer, Iâ€™m using this project to:
- Strengthen my problem-solving skills
- Practice writing clean and efficient code
- Build consistency through regular programming challenges

## Goal
Solve at least 100 problems from Project Euler, covering a range of difficulty levels.

## Structure
- Each problem is saved in a separate Python file.
- Filenames follow the pattern: `problem##.py` (e.g., `problem01.py`).
- Files are grouped in 10s in different folders (folder `1-10` contain problems 1 to 10).

## Technologies Used
- Python3
- C
  
  
## How to Run
Make sure Python 3 is installed. Run a solution file like this:

`in linux terminal`
python3 problem01.py

## Acknowledgements
Thanks to Project Euler for creating this rich collection of problems.

### Timeline
- 11/04/2025 to 29/04/2025: solved 25 questions
